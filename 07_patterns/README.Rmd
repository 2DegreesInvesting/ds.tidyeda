# Patterns

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```

Patterns reveal covariation. 

Models are a tool for extracting patterns out of
data.

If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

* Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

* How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

* How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

* What other variables might affect the relationship?

* Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

### Warm up

Longer `waiting` times are associated with longer `eruptions`

```{r}
ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions, waiting)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Remove the pattern and plot again

```{r}
mod <- lm(waiting ~ eruptions, data = faithful)

faithful %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mod) %>%
  mutate(resid = resid) %>%
  ggplot(aes(eruptions, resid)) + geom_point()
```

### What is the relationship between price and quality?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "The worst diamonds seem most expensive")
```

It's hard to understand the relationship between `cut` (quality) and `price`
because ...

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, carat)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Weight and quality are tightly related",
    subtitle = "Bigger diamonds tend to be of worse quality."
  )
```

and ...

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Price and weight are tightly related",
    subtitle = "Bigger diamonds tend to be more expensive."
  )
```

* Remove the relationship between price and weight.
* Explore price vs. quality again.

```{r}
mod <- lm(log(price) ~ log(carat), data = diamonds)

diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  add_residuals(mod) %>% 
  mutate(resid = exp(resid))
  
ggplot(diamonds2, aes(cut, resid)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Relative to their size, better diamonds are more expensive.")
```

### Insights

* Patterns reveal covariation.

* If variation adds uncertainty, covariation reduces it. 

* If two variables covary:

    * You can use one to better predict the second.
    * If the relationship is causal (a special case), you can use one variable
    to control the second.

* Models are a tool for extracting patterns out of data.
