### Questions

-   Why explore your data? To understand your data.

-   How to explore your data? Using **questions** as tools to focus on a
    specific part of your data.

Two types of questions are always useful:

-   What type of **variation** occurs within my variables?

-   What type of **covariation** occurs between my variables?

### Definitions

-   Variable \~ column.

-   Value \~ cell.

-   Observation \~ row.

-   Tabular data \~ spreadsheet.

-   Tidy data ([paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf),
    [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package).

> Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a
> specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a
> row.

### Variation

> Variation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from
> measurement to measurement.

> Every variable has its own pattern of variation.

> The best way to understand that pattern is to visualise the
> distribution of the variableâ€™s values.
