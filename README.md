A series of meetups about the exploring data with the tidyverse.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to explore data with the tidyverse. At the end
of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Explore the variation in your data – visually with ggplot2 and
    analytically with dplyr.
-   Manipulate and visualize unusual and missing values.
-   Explore the covariation between categorical and continuous
    variables.
-   Explore patterns in your data and extract them with a model.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Prerequisites

This meetup helps you quickly meet the prerequisites for the rest of
this meetup-series. It covers the minimum elements of a defensive
workflow, and of the data-science toolkit you’ll need during this
series.

Objectives:

-   Overview the elements of a defensive workflow and know where to
    learn more.

## The data science workflow and toolkit: An overview

This meetup overviews the data science workflow and the toolkit you’ll
need for the rest of this meetup series.

Objectives:

-   Overview the data-science workflow and toolkit.
-   Introduce rmarkdown documents.
-   Overview the tool for visualization: ggplot2.
-   Overview the tool for transformation: dplyr.

## Exploring variation with ggplot2 and dplyr

This meetup covers
[Variation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#variation).

Objectives:

-   Understand the role of “questions” in an exploratory data analysis.
-   Review the definitions of the main components of a data set.
-   Explore the distribution of a categorical variable.
-   Explore the distribution of a continuous variable.
-   Explore the distribution of multiple groups of data in a single
    plot.

### Typical, unusual, and missing values.

This meetup covers strategies to manipulate and visualize
[typical](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#typical-values),
[unusual](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#unusual-values),
and
[missing](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#missing-values-2)
values.

Objectives:

-   Visualize the most common and rare values in a dataset.
-   Explore outliers analytically, and by zooming into a plot.
-   Transforming incorrect values into missing values.
-   Convert missing values into a logical variable so you can visualize
    them.

## Next

-   Explore the covariation between categorical and continuous
    variables.
-   Explore patterns in your data and extract them with a model.
