A series of meetups about the exploring data with the tidyverse.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to explore data with the tidyverse. At the end
of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Explore the variation in your data – visually with ggplot2 and
    analytically with dplyr.
-   Manipulate and visualize unusual and missing values.
-   Explore the covariation between categorical and continuous
    variables.
-   Explore patterns in your data and extract them with a model.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Prerequisites

This meetup helps you quickly meet the prerequisites for the rest of
this meetup-series. It covers the minimum elements of a defensive
workflow, and of the data-science toolkit you’ll need during this
series.

Objectives:

-   Overview the elements of a defensive workflow and know where to
    learn more.

## The data science workflow and toolkit: An overview

This meetup overviews the data science workflow and the toolkit you’ll
need for the rest of this meetup series.

Objectives:

-   Overview the data-science workflow and toolkit.
-   Introduce rmarkdown documents.
-   Overview the tool for visualization: ggplot2.
-   Overview the tool for transformation: dplyr.

## Exploring variation with ggplot2 and dplyr

This meetup covers
[Variation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#variation).

Objectives:

-   Understand the role of “questions” in an exploratory data analysis.
-   Review the definitions of the main components of a data set.
-   Explore the distribution of a categorical variable.
-   Explore the distribution of a continuous variable.
-   Explore the distribution of multiple groups of data in a single
    plot.

## Typical values

This meetup covers strategies to manipulate and visualize [typical
values](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#typical-values).

Objectives:

-   Visualize the most common and rare values in a dataset.

## Unusual, and missing values

This meetup covers strategies to manipulate and visualize
[unusual](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#unusual-values),
and
[missing](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#missing-values-2)
values.

Objectives:

-   Explore outliers analytically, and by zooming into a plot.
-   Transforming incorrect values into missing values.
-   Convert missing values into a logical variable so you can visualize
    them.

### Covariation: One categorical and one continuous variable

This meetup covers the first part of
[Covariation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#covariation):
[Visualizing the relationship between a categorical variable and a
continuous
variable](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#cat-cont).
We’ll also discuss some ways to make the code of your plots clearer
using “noise cancelling” techniques.

Objectives:

-   Visualize the covariation between a categorical and a continuous
    variable.

-   Omit common, memorable arguments: `data`, `mapping`, `x`, and `y`.

-   Save ggplot elements and plots as variables.

### Covariation: Two categorical variables and two continuous variables

This meetup covers the last part of
[Covariation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#covariation):
Exploring the relationship between [two categorical
variables](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#two-categorical-variables)
and between [two continuous
variables](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#two-continuous-variables).

Objectives:

-   Explore the covariation between two categorical variables.

-   Map count to area and to colour-fill.

-   Explore the covariation between two continuous variables.

-   Solve over-plotting with transparency and bins.

-   Categorize a continuous variable then use a boxplot.

-   Map the width of a boxplot to the number of data points.

## Patterns and models

This meetup covers [Patterns and
models](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#patterns-and-models).

Objectives:

-   Explore the relationship between two variables.

-   Extract a pattern with a model.

-   Explore the relationship between two variables after removing a
    pattern.
