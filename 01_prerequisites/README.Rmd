### Defensive workflow

(Find RStudio commands with: Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + P)

[Start from a blank slate every time you restart R](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html):

* Save workspace on quit: Never.
* Load workspace on start: Off.
* Restart R session.

[Use RStudio projects](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html#rstudio-projects):

* Create a new project.
* Open project.
* File > Recent projects

Tips:

* Have a dedicated folder for your projects.
* Launch recent projects with: Alt + F > J
* Launch projects with a dedicated app (Alfred, Albert, etc.)

[Practice safe paths](https://rstats.wtf/safe-paths.html):

```{r error = TRUE}
# Good
path <- here::here("data", "greeting.txt")
path
readLines(path)

# Bad
path <- "/a/fragile path/that/only/i/have/data/greeting.txt"
readLines(path)
```
