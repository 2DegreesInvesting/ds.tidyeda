### Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Covariation

* The tendency for two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

* To spot covariation, visualise the relationship between the variables. 

* How you do it depends on the type of variables you have:

    * A categorical variable and a continuous variable (today).
    * Two categorical variables.
    * Two continuous variables.

### A categorical and continuous variable.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  select(price, cut)
```

#### Freaquency plot

This isn't very useful.

```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = price, colour = cut))
```

Same

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = price, colour = cut))
```
The variation of count across values of cut is too much. To make the comparison
easier we need to standardize the valyes of `y`. Let's plot density: The count
standardize so that the area under each curve is one.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = price, y = ..density.., colour = cut))
```

Surprisingly, fair diamonds (the lowest quality) seem to have the highest average price!

#### Box plot

![](eda-boxplot.png)

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

* The boxplots are compact so we can more easily compare them.

* Are better quality diamonds cheaper on average?

--

* `cut` is an "ordered" factor.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  distinct(cut) %>% 
  pull()
```

* In the `mpg` dataset, the variable `class` isn't ordered.

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  distinct(class) %>% 
  pull()
```

* The trend is hard to see on how highway mileage (`hwy`) varies across classes:

```{r}
class_hwy <- aes(
  x = class,
  y = hwy
)
class_hwy
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(class_hwy)
```

`reorder()` helps you order values of a categorical variable like `cut`.

```{r}
class_reordered_by_median_hwy <- aes(
  x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median),
  y = hwy
)
class_reordered_by_median_hwy
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(class_reordered_by_median_hwy)
p
```

If you have long variable names you may better flip the plot.

```{r}
p + coord_flip()
```
