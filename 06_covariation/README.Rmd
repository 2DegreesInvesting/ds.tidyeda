### Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Covariation

* The tendency for two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

* To spot covariation, visualise the relationship between the variables. 

* How you do it depends on the type of variables you have:

    * A categorical variable and a continuous variable.
    * Two categorical variables.
    * Two continuous variables.

### A categorical and continuous variable

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  select(cut, price)
```

#### Freaquency plot

```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = price, colour = cut))
```

Same with "noise cancelling" turned on

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = price, colour = cut))
```

This isn't very useful.

The variation of count across values of cut is too much. 

To make the comparison easier we need to standardize the valyes of `y`.

Let's plot density: The count standardize so that the area under each curve is
one.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = price, y = ..density.., colour = cut))
```

Surprisingly, fair diamonds (the lowest quality) seem to have the highest average price!

#### Box plot

![](eda-boxplot.png)

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

* The boxplots are compact so we can more easily compare them.

* Are better quality diamonds cheaper on average?

Note:

* `cut` is an "ordered" factor.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  distinct(cut) %>% 
  pull()
```

* Compare: In the `mpg` dataset, the variable `class` isn't ordered.

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  distinct(class) %>% 
  pull()
```

* The trend is hard to see on how highway mileage (`hwy`) varies across classes:

```{r}
class_hwy <- aes(
  x = class,
  y = hwy
)
class_hwy
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(class_hwy)
```

`reorder()` helps you order values of a categorical variable.

```{r}
class_reordered_by_median_hwy <- aes(
  x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median),
  y = hwy
)
class_reordered_by_median_hwy
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(class_reordered_by_median_hwy)
p
```

If you have long variable names you may better flip the plot.

```{r}
p + coord_flip()
```


### Two categorical variables

Data:

* `color`: Colour, ordered from D (best) to J (worst).
* `cut`: Quality, ordered from Fair to Ideal.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  select(_____, ___)
```

Two categorical variables, mapping count to area.

```{r}
ggplot(________) +
  geom_count(aes(_____, ___))
```

Two categorical variables, mapping count to colour fill.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  _____(color, cut) %>%  # Note the change from %>% to +
  ggplot() + 
    geom_tile(aes(color, cut, fill = _))
```

### Two continuous variables

Data:

* `carat`: Weight.
* `price`: Price.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ______(carat, _____)
```

Two continuous variables, suffering overplotting.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(carat, price))
```

Solve over-plotting with transparency.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(carat, price), _____ = 1 / 100)
```

Use smaller data.

```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 3)
```

Solve over-plotting with square 2-dimensional bins.

```{r}
ggplot(smaller) +
  geom______(aes(carat, price))
```

Solve over-plotting with hexagonal bins.

```{r}
# install.packages("hexbin")
ggplot(smaller) +
  geom____(aes(carat, price))
```

Categorize a continuous variable and visualize covariation with a boxplot.

```{r}
cut_carat <- smaller %>% 
  mutate(carat2 = cut_width(carat, 0.1)) %>% 
  select(price, carat, carat2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(carat))
cut_carat
```

```{r}
ggplot(cut_carat) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(carat2, price))
```

Similar.

```{r}
ggplot(smaller) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(carat, price, _____ = cut_width(carat, 0.1)))
```

Map the width of a boxplot to the number of observations:

1. Make the box-width proportional to the number of points in each bin.

```{r}
ggplot(smaller) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(carat, price, group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)), 
    varwidth = ____
  )
```

2. Display approximately the same number of points in each bin. 

```{r}
ggplot(smaller) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(carat, price, group = cut_______(carat, 20)))
```
