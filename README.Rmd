A series of meetups about the exploring data with the tidyverse.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to explore data with the tidyverse. At the end of this
series you will be able to do things like these:

* Explore the variation in your data -- visually with ggplot2 and
analytically with dplyr.
* Manipulate and visualize unusual and missing values.
* Explore the covariation between categorical and continuous variables.
* Explore patterns in your data and extract them with a model.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Overview of the data-science workflow and toolkit

This meetup overviews the data-science workflow and toolkit. It helps you
quickly meet the prerequisites for the rest of this meetup-series. 

Objectives:

* Overview the data-science workflow.
* Overview the data-science toolkit.
* Setup an RStudio project to explore data with minimal friction.
* Create a toy data-science report.

## Next

* Manipulate and visualize unusual and missing values.
* Explore the covariation between categorical and continuous variables.
* Explore patterns in your data and extract them with a model.
